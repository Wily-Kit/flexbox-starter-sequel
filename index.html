            <main>
                <p>I'm a Responsive Designer & Developer who thinks that visual storytelling is just okay. When I'm not working, navigating the sheer sensory torture that is NYC public transportation, being sarcastic, or reading, I can be found binge-watching The Big Bang Theory, drinking wine, and feeding the feral cats that live in my parking lot.</p>

            <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                <p>I was born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska. My father is American, and my mother was from Finland. Because of this, my sister and I got to go with our mother to Helsinki several times throughout our childhood to see the country of our heritage & get to know the trans-Atlantic side of our family. Those were some of my happiest memories!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>One of my many passions is the arts. My entire youth was spent singing in choirs & musicals and acting in plays, and I have a BFA in Theater. One of my other passions is animals. I'm vegan, an animal rights activist, and I'm active with the TNR program to control the feral cat populations in our cities.</p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p>Random factoids: I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at the age of 46. It was a blessing, as I can understand my weirdness so much better now! I have a brown belt in Taekwondo. I was going for my black belt, but I got a career-ending injury before I could test. I've visited Mexico, Canada, Finland, Japan, and I once lived in the UK.</p>
